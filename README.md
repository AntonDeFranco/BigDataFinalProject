#Weather Data Pipeline and Visualization Project
Project Overview
This project involves creating a real-time data pipeline to fetch weather data from OpenWeatherMap, stream it through Google Cloud Pub/Sub, store it in BigQuery, and visualize it in Looker Studio. It utilizes various Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services to create an end-to-end solution for weather data analysis.

Components
OpenWeatherMap API: Provides real-time weather data.
Google Cloud Function: Fetches weather data and publishes it to a Pub/Sub topic.
Google Cloud Pub/Sub: Serves as a messaging queue for weather data.
Google Cloud Dataflow: Streams data from Pub/Sub to BigQuery.
Google BigQuery: Stores weather data for analysis.
Looker Studio: Visualizes data from BigQuery for insights.
Setup and Configuration
1. OpenWeatherMap API
Register and obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap.
API Endpoint: http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather
2. Google Cloud Function
Written in Python.
Fetches data from OpenWeatherMap.
Transforms data to match BigQuery schema.
Publishes data to the specified Pub/Sub topic.
3. Google Cloud Pub/Sub
Set up a Pub/Sub topic for receiving weather data.
Ensure proper permissions for the Cloud Function to publish messages.
4. Google Cloud Dataflow
Use the "Pub/Sub Subscription to BigQuery" template to create a Dataflow job.
Configure the job to read from the Pub/Sub topic and write to the BigQuery table.
5. Google BigQuery
Create a dataset and table to store weather data.
Define a schema that aligns with the transformed data structure.
BigQuery Schema
vbnet
Copy code
timestamp: TIMESTAMP,
latitude: FLOAT,
longitude: FLOAT,
temperature: FLOAT,
humidity: INTEGER,
pressure: INTEGER,
wind_speed: FLOAT,
wind_deg: INTEGER,
clouds: INTEGER,
visibility: INTEGER,
weather_main: STRING,
weather_description: STRING,
temp_min: FLOAT,
temp_max: FLOAT,
feels_like: FLOAT,
sea_level: INTEGER,
grnd_level: INTEGER,
sunrise: TIMESTAMP,
sunset: TIMESTAMP
6. Looker Studio
Connect Looker Studio to the BigQuery dataset.
Create reports and dashboards to visualize and analyze the weather data.
Usage Instructions
Deploy the Cloud Function with the necessary environment variables (API key, Pub/Sub topic, etc.).
Ensure the Dataflow job is running and streaming data to BigQuery.
Publish weather data regularly by triggering the Cloud Function (scheduled or manual trigger).
Use Looker Studio to create and view reports based on the data in BigQuery.
Monitoring and Maintenance
Regularly monitor the Cloud Function and Dataflow job for errors or interruptions.
Check BigQuery for data consistency and completeness.
Update the Cloud Function code for any changes in the API response structure.
